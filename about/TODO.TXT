GraphApp "To Do" List

Controls
  - scroll_bar      needs access to internal ints
  - menus           needs scrolling, dynamic font update, keyboard control
  - text_field      needs timer scrolling
  - text_box        needs more testing, and faster scrolling
  - all controls which display text need extra code to handle
    different text directions

Dialogs
  - all dialogs:   need to remember user's last positioning of dialogs
  - add text equivalents for all dialogs in case GUI is uninitialised

Drawing
  - text drawing direction TOP_TO_BOTTOM needs to be implemented

App object
  - default text drawing direction?
  - default text alignment?
  - 'skin' settings?

Windows
  - need a way to obtain MS-Windows this_instance and prev_instance
	outside the WinMain - can this be done???
  - implement DISABLED windows

Fonts
  - ability to set font search path
  - ability to set default font name
  - add native font support (done for ISO Latin-1 text so far)
	- to draw to bitmaps and windows
		- detect Unicode support in the font (tricky)
		- drawing RIGHT_TO_LEFT (tricky)
	- to draw to images (tricky)
	- to generate a clipmask (tricky)
  - add scaling of portable Subfont Image (how to match best resolution?)
  - nearest match on font names? (helvetica => arial?)
  - add more bitmapped fonts (ongoing)
  - improve default font in case unifont isn't available!!!!
