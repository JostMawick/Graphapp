Subject: Makefile for VC

Hi there,
I have updated my makefile for MSVC.
Follow these steps :
1. mkdir build (or any other name)
2. cd build (then copy into it the Makefile named msvc.mak)
3. rename that msvc.mak file to Makefile
4. nmake
copy 'GraphApp.lib' into the appropriate dir.
No need to set '/Dmain=app_main'.
If I am right, the only update is the files that deal with the cursors.
