How to make Graphapp with Linux with X11R6 and gcc

Go to graphapp/src
Type ./configure
That should build a makefile for you (after compiling
and running apptypes.c to produce apptypes.h and then
adding rules/x11rules.txt to the generated makefile).

If that fails, you could try copying linux.mak to
graphapp/src and rename it as makefile, then type
  make static
or
  make dynamic
to produce the static or dynamic library.

If the library has been produced, try typing
  make demo
to produce the program demo/imagine which can then
by run by typing
  demo/imagine demo/*.jpg
