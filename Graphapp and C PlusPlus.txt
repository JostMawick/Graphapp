To use Graphapp as a C++ Library instead of just a plain C Library,
modify the graphapp.h header and recompile the library.

Add the following code pieces at top and bottom of graphapp.h before
building the GraphApp library.  The resulting LIB will now work
properly with C++ without any name mangling.

#ifndef __GRAPHAPP_H__
#define __GRAPHAPP_H__

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

(rest of file)

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

#endif
