  <B>Instructions</B>
  <P>
  If you are using Borland C++ 3.11, you can get by with downloading
  just the file graphlib.zip. It contains a Readme file which has all
  the info you need to get going.</P>
  <P>
  If you are using any other compiler you will need to download graphapp.zip
  which contains the full source code for the library. You will have to
  put the .c files into a new project and build it using the Large Memory
  Model. The output from that project should go into a file called
  graphapp.lib. There are instructions in a Readme file.</P>
  <P>
  <B>If you are using Borland C version 3.11,</B> installation should be easy.
  Dowload the file graphlib.zip and take it home. Do the following:</P>
  <PRE>
   mkdir c:\graphapp
   copy a:\graphlib.zip c:\graphapp
   cd c:\graphapp
   unzip graphlib.zip
   copy graphapp.h c:\borlandc\include
  </PRE>
  That sequence of instructions will copy the file onto your C: drive,
  unzip it and copy the graphapp.h header file into your
  compiler's include directory. The instructions for Microsoft C or
  later versions of Borland C should be similar.
  <P>
  The lib file is a static library object file, not a DLL. Do not
  place it into your Windows\System directory, it won't do anything there.
  Instead, each program you make should include the graphapp.lib file
  in itself. Copy the lib file into c:\borlandc\lib or into every
  directory where you want to compile. Then include it in your
  projects as if it is a C file.</P>
  <P>
  <B>If you are using Microsoft C,</B>
  you should add the source code files into a project and build it to
  produce a statically linking library (not a DLL). You will have to
  consult your compiler's manuals to find out how to do this. Having
  created a library you can then use it in projects as you would any
  other library.</P>
  <P>
  Or, you can directly include the source code files in a project
  together with your C files, and link them all straight into a exe file.
  This will save you having to create a lib file.</P>
  <P>
  <B>If you are using Turbo C,</B> or some other compiler which dates
  from the pre-Windows era, you will probably not be able to use this
  library at all. Microsoft changed the format of executable files when
  it released Windows 3 and hence older compilers cannot produce
  Windows programs.</P>

  <P>
  Forward any questions you have to Loki.</P>
  <P>
  I would be interested to find out the installation instructions for
  Microsoft C.</P>
