<H3>NOTES</H3>
<P>
A control can have the keyboard focus, which means that in its parent window, if a user types a key on the keyboard, that key click will be sent to the control which has focus rather than to the window itself.
<P>
To set focus to a particular control, use <B>set_focus</B>. This will remove focus from whatever control previously had the focus, if any, and it will redraw all affected controls (since some controls appear differently if they have the focus).
<P>
Use <B>has_focus</B> to determine if the given control has the keyboard focus.
<P>
Focus has no effect on mouse events.
<P>
The <B>pass_event</B> function can be called within a call-back function to pass a keyboard event up the object hierarchy (to the enclosing parent control or window). This might be used if a control handles some events, but not others. For instance, a text field handles ordinary key strokes, but might not want to accept 'Enter' or 'Tab' key events; instead it might want to pass these events to the window's call-back functions.
