<H3>NOTES</H3>
<P>
The <B>new_image_check_box</B> function creates a <I>check box</I> which displays an image. This is similar to an image button, except that clicking in the button with a mouse will swap its state between unchecked (normal button appearance) and checked (pressed in appearance). If the control is disabled, a greyed version of the image will be displayed instead.
<P>
Each time the control changes between a checked and unchecked state, the call-back function <TT>fn</TT> is called after the event and the image check box is passed to the function as its parameter.
This call-back function can be set to NULL, which means no function will be called in response to checking or unchecking the image check box.
<P>
The <B>add_image_check_box</B> function works in the same way as <B>new_image_check_box</B>, except that it attaches the image check box to a control rather than directly to a window.
<P>
The function <B>is_checked</B> can be used to determine if the image check box is currently checked. The function <B>check</B> can be used to change the state to checked, and <B>uncheck</B> can be used to restore an unchecked state.
<P>
To implement mutually exclusive sets of image check boxes (like radio button groups), the call-back function must uncheck the other image check boxes in each set whenever a new image check box becomes checked.
