<H3>NOTES</H3>
<P>
A control can be enabled so it can receive user input and mouse clicks, or disabled so that it cannot.
<P>
To enable a control to receive user input and mouse clicks, call the <B>enable</B> function. By default, when a control is created, it is always enabled. However, this function can re-enable a control which has been disabled.
<P>
To disable a control, and make it ignore user input, use <B>disable</B>.
A disabled control will usually have grey text, and will not respond to the user.
An exception to this is a disabled textbox or field, which will appear normal, but cannot be edited or modified by the user.
<P>
The <B>is_enabled</B> function will return zero if the control is disabled, and one if it is enabled.
