<H3>What Is GraphApp?</H3>
<P>
<B>GraphApp</B> is a cross-platform graphics library written in the
C programming language. It works with a variety of operating system
and windowing system combinations, including Microsoft Windows, X-Windows,
Linux, Macintosh OSX, and other Unixes. It gives the programmer
access to buttons, text boxes, windows, fonts, colours, and so on,
in a platform independent and easy to learn manner, so that
graphical programs can be easily created and ported to different
operating systems.
