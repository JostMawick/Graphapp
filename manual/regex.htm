<H3>NOTES</H3>
<P>
The <B>regex_match</B> function performs a regular expression
match on the given expression <TT>regexp</TT> and <TT>text</TT>.
It returns non-zero (true) if there is a match, or zero (false)
if there is no match. Both strings are assumed to be UTF-8 strings.
<P>
The regular expression language is very simple:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>"abc"	matches the exact string "abc"</LI>
<LI>"a*bc"	matches "a" followed by zero or more chars, then "bc"</LI>
<LI>"abc*"	matches any string which starts with "abc"</LI>
<LI>"*abc"	matches any string which ends with "abc"</LI>
<LI>"*abc*"	matches any string which contains "abc"</LI>
<LI>"a?bc"	matches "a" followed by any one UTF-8 char, then "bc"</LI>
<LI>"*.jpg"	matches any string which ends in ".jpg"</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The only special characters are '*' and '?'.
There is currently no way to escape these characters.
The '.', '^', '$', and '\' characters all have no special meaning.
Strings must match at the start and end of the string unless
the '*' character is used at the start or end.
This scheme is similar to a shell match, rather than <TT>grep</TT>.
