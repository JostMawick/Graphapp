<H3>NOTES</H3>
<P>
The <B>new_label</B> function creates on the specified window a text label which cannot be edited by the user. The text string is aligned within the rectangle according to the value of the alignment parameter. Values such as <B>ALIGN_LEFT</B>, <B>ALIGN_RIGHT</B> or <B>ALIGN_CENTER</B> can be specified. A value of zero corresponds to <B>ALIGN_LEFT</B>+<B>VALIGN_TOP</B>.
<P>
The <B>add_label</B> function works in the same way as <B>new_label</B>, except that it attaches the label to a control rather than directly to a window.
<P>
A label does not respond to mouse or keyboard events; in fact, these events pass straight through a label to the underlying parent control or window. The initial background colour of a label is transparent, so that only the text of the label is drawn against the background of the window.
<P>
It can be seen from the list of possible text alignments above, both American and British spellings of the the word 'centre' are legal.
<P>
The horizontal alignments are:
<UL>
<LI><B>ALIGN_LEFT</B> (the default) makes the text start at the left hand edge of the rectangle.
<LI><B>ALIGN_RIGHT</B> causes the text to appear at the rightmost edge of the rectangle. This is useful in fill-in forms.
<LI><B>ALIGN_JUSTIFY</B> is similar to ALIGN_LEFT, except if the text spans more than one line, in which case the spaces between words will be enlarged so each line fills the rectangle horizontally.
<LI><B>ALIGN_CENTER</B> or <B>ALIGN_CENTRE</B> have the effect of horizontally centering the text within the rectangle.
</UL>
The vertical alignments are explained below:
<UL>
<LI><B>VALIGN_TOP</B> (the default) means the label's text will be drawn starting from the top of the label's rectangle.
<LI><B>VALIGN_BOTTOM</B> draws the text so that it fills the label from the bottom of its rectangle.
<LI><B>VALIGN_JUSTIFY</B> vertically justifies the text, so the inter-line spacing will be large enough for the text to fill the label's rectangle.
<LI><B>VALIGN_CENTER</B> or <B>VALIGN_CENTRE</B> vertically centers the text within the label's rectangle.
</UL>
Either a vertical, or a horizontal alignment can be specified, or a combination of the two, using the plus or bitwise-or operators to combine the alignments.
