<H3>NOTES</H3>
<P>
The <B>show_control</B> and <B>hide_control</B> functions make a control visible or invisible on its parent. The <B>is_visible</B> function returns zero if the control's state indicates it is not visible, or one if it is visible.
<P>
By default, controls are visible when they are created, but windows are not.
Visibility is the quality of whether the control should be drawn if it is not obscured, <I>not</I> whether the control is currently unobscured.
<P>
A control might be visible, even if its parent window is not. Every object has its own visibility state, which is separate to every other object's state.
