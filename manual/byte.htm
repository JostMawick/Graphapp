<H3>NOTES</H3>
<P>
A <I>byte</I> is simply another name for an <I>unsigned char</I>, which is defined by the C language to be an 8-bit integer.
<P>
The <I>byte</I> type has been defined in this library as a convenient short-hand for an unsigned 8-bit integer, and is used in a few functions.
It is quite acceptable to use <I>unsigned char</I> instead, if you prefer, since the two are equivalent.
<P>
The possible range of numbers which can be stored in a <I>byte</I> are 0 to 255 inclusive.
<P>
If your compiler does not allow the definition of this type, replace all instances with <I>unsigned char</I> instead.
